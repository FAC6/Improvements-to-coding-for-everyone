#Learning JavaScript with Codewars & Codecademy.

[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com) and [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) are two fantastic resources for learning JavaScript. Whether you are looking to apply to Founders & Coders (in which case they are necessary) or simply just want to learn, completing Codecademy’s JavaScript course and then solving some katas on Codewars is a great learning route. Good as these resources are, if you are new to programming, they are not always 100% straightforward and can leave you confused. Here are some tips on what to do when you get stuck.


##Codecademy
If you are completely new this the best place to start.

1. If you are stuck re-read the info on the side (sounds obvious but I often forgot to do this).
2. Checkout the Q and A forum, people often have similar problems and there are a few bugs which can be picked up here.
3. Use an online code editor like [repl.it] (https://repl.it/) to check your code is working, tweak your code and see if you can get it to behave the way you want.
4. Use google, if you find the answer, read around or play with the code to work out how it works.
5. If a part of Codecademy is confusing you, look online for other resources (youtube, blogs etc) that may explain the concept in way that relates better to you.

##Codewars
Once you have some basic knowledge of JavaScript, it’s time to start using your knowledge solving problems on codewars.

1. The tips mentioned above for Codecademy are also useful here.
2. For longer and complex problems, try and break down the problem and write a solution using pseudo code (code in note form - it doesn’t need to run correctly or be syntactically correct) . Write functions or sections of your code in a  code editor- this way you break down the problem into smaller parts and can identify where the problem is.
3. GOOGLE EVERYTHING. Seriously. Google pretty much what you have to do for the kata i.e. 'How to turn an array of strings into an array of numbers js'. The answer will be out there somewhere. Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) and Stack Overflow are great websites for this. W3schools also ok but a bit more basic. 
4. There are some bugs in Codewars. For example if you are working on a problem that doesn’t have any tests written for it, it may fail to pass its’ tests, but passes ok if you submit it directly.
5. Write your own kata - Codewars gives you lots of credit for this.
6. `console.log()` is often an essential way to help you complete challenges. You’ll often need to see exactly which cases your code is failing at, by using console.log(<your chosen input goes here>) you’ll uncover the often random parameters being passed into your code. You’ll need to hit the run tests or submit button to see the output displayed .
7. Once you have completed a kata and can see the solutions compare yours to the top rated solution. You should spend a little time studying the methods and approaches used in this top solution, as this will help you understand other JavaScript methods and more elegant ways of solving problems that are often more readable.
