# Improvements-to-coding-for-everyone
A place for discussing the improvements that can be made to the 'Coding for Everyone' event, including resources to help beginners.  

2/11/15 Below are the notes from todays discussion on how to improve the event and suggested structure. Please raise issues to start the discussion on how we can keep improving this going forward!

* Intro message on meetup.com needs improving. Perhaps something like this:
	> We welcome all levels at this meetup - please bring a laptop and find someone of similar level to talk and walk through code together. We like Codecademy and CodeWars, a link to our guide for these can be found here (add link after issue #1 is resolved) A few Founders & Coders students and organisers will be there if you have any questions about the course or the space (and we'll try to help with code!). Please do ask to join our gitter channel here:

	> https://gitter.im/codingforeveryone

	> We look forward to meeting and working with you!

* **WEAR A FAC T-SHIRT**! (They're at the back if you've forgotten yours!)
* **Greet people** at the door, asking:
 * Is it your first time?
 * Do you know what the space is about?
 	* If no and they missed presentation then explain
 * What is your Coding experience?
	  (more suggested questions appreciated)
 * **Then point out someone of similar level**	  


* Cast on the screen:
 * Gitter channel / signing up to Github
 * FAC website
 * Codecademy and Codewars     


* Write on whiteboard:
 * Who the FACers are for the event
 * Katas of the week   


* Pairing needs to be more encouraged, so be proactive!

* **Give a talk** explaining about the course **every week** - what it is, what we do
