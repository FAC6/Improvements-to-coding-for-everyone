# Improvements-to-coding-for-everyone
A place for discussing the improvements that can be made to the 'Coding for Everyone' event, including resources to help beginners.  

2/11/15 Below are the notes from todays discussion on how to improve the event and suggested stucture. Please raise issues to start the discussion on how we can keep improving this going forward!

* Intro message on meetup.com needs improving.
* WEAR A FAC T-SHIRT!
* Greeting people at the door
		* Is it your first time?
		* Do you know what the space is about?
 	    - if the answer is no and not planning to do a presentation then explain.
	  (more suggested questions appreciated)
		

* Cast some things on the screen: Who the FACers are for the event, explaining things they can do eg. Codecademy &   Codewars (specific kataâ€™s recommended), including signing up to github and getting on the gitter channel.
* Pairing more encouraged, be proactive.
* Give a talk explaining about the course (debate about how often we should do this, weekly monthly?)
		-what it is, what we do.
* Encourage Codecademy & Codewars
		-recommend kata
		-link to kata guide (made by Rachel another Readme on this repo)
