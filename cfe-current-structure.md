## Coding for Everyone structure guidelines

This document is intended as a guide for a structure to the 'coding for everyone' meetups on monday evenings at the Globetown campus. It is not intended as a doctrine, and should be changed if agreed that the current format with benefit from change.

## Supervisors

Try to organise who will be running the next meetup on the Monday **before** so there are no last minute surprises with who is running the evening. If you can't attend the meetup you had subscribed to, please find a replacement.

## Timeline

**6-6.15pm**
* Welcome people
* Check if this is their first time here
* Gauge coding level - perhaps split people by coding level onto the two different tables
* Introduce people to gitter channel

**6.15pm**
* Give an initial presentation
* Direct people to Codeacamemy or Codewars
* Encourage pairing

**Then..**
* Be on hand to help anyone who might need it
* Talking through their code with them and letting them do most of the talking can do **a lot** of good

## Presentation

### Minimum

A short presentation should be given, introducing FAC and Coding for Everyone, explaining a bit about the space and what they can expect.

### Workshop

If the FACcers feel inclined to organise it, a longer presentation goes down very well. It could be a small workshop on *array methods*, or on basic *DOM manipulation*, or on *Bootstrap* or *vanilla CSS*.

Anything which introduces a new topic or concept to the guests, and allows for some group learning.

Possible subjects:

* Scope in Javascript
* Loops
* Recursion
* Objects
* Methods of strings, objects, arrays, functions etc.
* Regular Expressions
* Node
* Event Handling

## To be projected

We have another markdown file in this repo located [here](https://github.com/FAC6/Improvements-to-coding-for-everyone/blob/master/toProject.md) which is what we project on the board. Again, it is not a doctrine and can be moderated according to the content of the evening.

## House rules

Pack up by 8:30. We hate to say goodbye to guests but there's always the week after!
