## Presentation

### Minimum

A short presentation should be given, introducing FAC and Coding for Everyone, explaining a bit about the space and what they can expect.

### Workshop

If the FACcers feel inclined to organise it, a longer presentation goes down very well. It could be a small workshop on *array methods*, or on basic *DOM manipulation*, or on *Bootstrap* or *vanilla CSS*.

Anything which introduces a new topic or concept to the guests, and allows for some group learning.

[here we could provide a list of possible subjects for a workshop or longer presentation?]
